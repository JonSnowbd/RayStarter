## What

Describe what your game is.

## Building

The building is done entirely through `build.py`. Run `python build.py -h` for a list of
all the command options for the build.

This is extremely quick and automated, as the only things you need are an installation
of [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) in your gcc's lib and include folders.

#### Defines

This project defines a few things through the compiler. The first of which is platform,
it will either define `WINDOWS` or `LINUX` to denote platform, and second of all is release mode,
adding either `DEBUG` or `RELEASE`.

## Supported platforms

Where does your game run?
